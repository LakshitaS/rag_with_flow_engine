        <p>Watson Natural Language Processing Relations extraction encapsulates algorithms for extracting relations between two entity mentions. For example, in the text <em>Lionel Messi plays for FC Barcelona.</em> a relation extraction model may decide
          that the entities <code>Lionel Messi</code> and <code>F.C. Barcelona</code> are in a relationship with each other, and the relationship type is <code>works for</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Capabilities</strong></p>
        <p>Use this model to detect relations between discovered entities.</p>
        <p>The following table lists common relations types that are available out-of-the-box after you have run the entity models.</p>
