          <h2 id="data-prep">Preparing the data for training (data pre-processing)</h2>
          <p>During automatic data preparation, or pre-processing, AutoAI analyzes the training data and prepares it for model selection and pipeline generation. Most data sets contain missing values but machine learning algorithms typically expect no missing
            values. On exception to this rule is described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Opens a new window or tab">xgboost section 3.4</a>. AutoAI algorithms perform various missing value
            imputations in your data set by using various techniques, making your data ready for machine learning. In addition, AutoAI detects and categorizes features based on their data types, such as categorical or numerical. It explores encoding and
            scaling strategies that are based on the feature categorization.</p>

          <h2 id="auto-select">Automatic model selection</h2>
          <p>The second stage in an AutoAI experiment training is automated model selection. The automated model selection algorithm uses the Data Allocation by using Upper Bounds strategy. This approach sequentially allocates small subsets of training data
            among a large set of algorithms. The goal is to select an algorithm that gives near-optimal accuracy when trained on all data, while also minimizing the cost of misallocated samples. The system currently supports all Scikit-learn algorithms,
            and the popular XGBoost and LightGBM algorithms. Training and evaluation of models on large data sets is costly. The approach of starting small subsets and allocating incrementally larger ones to models that work well on the data set saves
            time, without sacrificing performance.&nbsp;Snap machine learning algorithms were added to the system to boost the performance even more.</p>
          <section id="section-selecting-algorithms-for-a-model">
            <h3 id="selecting-algorithms-for-a-model">Selecting algorithms for a model</h3>
            <p>Algorithms are selected to match the data and the nature of the model, but they can also balance accuracy and duration of runtime, if the model is configured for that option. For example, Snap ML algorithms are typically faster for training
              than Scikit-learn algorithms. They are often the preferred algorithms AutoAI selects automatically for cases where training is optimized for a shorter run time and accuracy. You can manually select them if training speed is a priority. For

            <p>Metrics for multi-class models generate scores for how well a pipeline performs against the specified measurement. For example, an F1 score averages <em>precision</em> (of the predictions made, how many positive predictions were correct) and
              <em>recall</em> (of all possible positive predictions, how many were predicted correctly).</p>
            <p>You can further refine a score by qualifying it to calculate the given metric globally (macro), per label (micro), or to weight an imbalanced data set to favor classes with more representation.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Metrics with the <em>micro</em> qualifier calculate metrics globally by counting the total number of true positives, false negatives and false positives.</li>
              <li>Metrics with the <em>macro</em> qualifier calculates metrics for each label, and finds their unweighted mean. All labels are weighted equally.</li>
              <li>Metrics with the <em>weighted</em> qualifier calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted by the contribution of each class. For example, in a data set that includes categories for apples, peaches, and plums, if there
                are many more instances of apples, the weighted metric gives greater importance to correctly predicting apples. This alters <em>macro</em> to account for label imbalance. Use a weighted metric such as F1-weighted for an imbalanced data
                set.</li>

          <section id="section-metrics-used-for-feature-importance">

            <p>For tree-based classification and regression algorithms such as Decision Tree, Extra Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosted, and LGBM, feature importances are their inherent feature importance scores based on the reduction in the
              criterion that is used to select split points, and calculated when these algorithms are trained on the training data.</p>
            <p>For nontree algorithms such as Logistic Regression, LInear Regression, SnapSVM, and Ridge, the feature importances are the feature importances of a Random Forest algorithm that is trained on the same training data as the nontree algorithm.</p>
            <p>For any algorithm, all feature importances are in the range between zero and one and have been normalized as the ratio with respect to the maximum feature importance.</p>

            <p>For feature engineering, AutoAI uses a novel approach that explores various feature construction choices in a structured, nonexhaustive manner, while progressively maximizing model accuracy by using reinforcement learning. This results in
              an optimized sequence of transformations for the data that best match the algorithms, or algorithms, of the model selection step. This table lists some of the transformations that are used and some well-known conditions under which they
              are useful. This is not an exhaustive list of scenarios where the transformation is useful, as that can be complex and hard to interpret. Finally, the listed scenarios are not an explanation of how the transformations are selected. The selection

          <h2 id="hyper-opt">Hyperparameter Optimization</h2>
          <p>The final stage in AutoAI is hyperparameter optimization. The AutoAI approach optimizes the parameters of the best performing pipelines from the previous phases. It is done by exploring the parameter ranges of these pipelines by using a black
            box hyperparameter optimizer called RBFOpt. RBFOpt is described in the research paper <a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2014/09/4538.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Opens a new window or tab">RBFOpt: an open-source library for black-box optimization with costly function evaluations</a>.
            RBFOpt is suited for AutoAI experiments because it is built for optimizations with costly evaluations, as in the case of training and scoring an algorithm. RBFOpt's approach builds and iteratively refines a surrogate model of the unknown objective
            function to converge quickly despite the long evaluation times of each iteration.</p>

          <section id="section-how-many-pipelines-are-created">
            <h3 id="how-many-pipelines-are-created">How many pipelines are created?</h3>
            <p>Two AutoAI parameters determine the number of pipelines:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>max_num_daub_ensembles:</strong> Maximum number (top-K ranked by DAUB model selection) of the selected algorithm, or estimator types, for example LGBMClassifierEstimator, XGBoostClassifierEstimator, or LogisticRegressionEstimator
                  to use in pipeline composition.&nbsp; The default is 1, where only the highest ranked by model selection algorithm type is used.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>num_folds:</strong> Number of subsets of the full data set to train pipelines in addition to the full data set. The default is 1 for training the full data set.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For each fold and algorithm type, AutoAI creates four pipelines of increased refinement, corresponding to:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Pipeline with default sklearn parameters for this algorithm type,</li>

            <h3 id="what-hyperparameter-optimization-is-applied-to-my-model">What hyperparameter optimization is applied to my model?</h3>
            <p>AutoAI uses a model-based, derivative-free global search algorithm, called RBfOpt, which is tailored for the costly machine learning model training and scoring evaluations that are required by hyperparameter optimization (HPO). In contrast
              to Bayesian optimization, which fits a Gaussian model to the unknown objective function, RBfOpt fits a radial basis function mode to accelerate the discovery of hyper-parameter configurations that maximize the objective function of the machine
              learning problem at hand. This acceleration is achieved by minimizing the number of expensive training and scoring machine learning models evaluations and by eliminating the need to compute partial derivatives.</p>
            <p>For each fold and algorithm type, AutoAI creates two pipelines that use HPO to optimize for the algorithm type.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first is based on optimizing this algorithm type based on the preprocessed (imputed/encoded/scaled) data set (pipeline 2) above).</li>
              <li>The second is based on optimizing the algorithm type based on optimized feature engineering of the preprocessed (imputed/encoded/scaled) data set.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The parameter values of the algorithms of all pipelines that are generated by AutoAI is published in status messages.</p>

            <h3 id="feature-sig">How is feature significance calculated?</h3>
            <p>When you configure a classification or regression experiment, you can optionally specify how to handle features with no impact on the model. The choices are to always remove the feature, remove them when it improves the model quality, or do
              not remove them. Feature significance is calculated as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Feature importance is calculated on data sample.</li>
              <li>Some estimators do not have built-in capabilities to return feature importances. In those cases, an estimator such as RandomForest is used to measure impact.</li>
              <li>The number of features matters - if the importance value for a feature is 0.0000000001 but there are a large number of low-importance features (for example, more than 200) then leaving or removing them can have some impact on the experiment
                results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In auto mode, the following steps are used to validate that removal of low-importance features does not affect the experiment results:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If removing all features with calculated 0 importance has some impact on model accuracy, Principal Component Analysis algorithm is applied to those features and select top K components explaining the 90% of variance across those insignificant
                features.</li>
              <li>Next, the transformed components are used as new features in place of original ones and the model is evaluated again.</li>
              <li>If there is still a drop in accuracy, all original features are added back to the experiment.</li>
            </ul>
