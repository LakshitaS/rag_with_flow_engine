          <section id="section-fm-check">
            <h3 id="fm-check">Do I need to check generated output for biased, inappropriate, or incorrect content?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you must review the generated output of foundation models. Third Party models have been trained with data that might contain biases and inaccuracies and can generate outputs containing misinformation, obscene or offensive language, or
              discriminatory content.</p>
            <p>In the Prompt Lab, when you toggle <strong>AI guardrails</strong> on, any sentence in the prompt text or model output that contains harmful language will be replaced with a message saying potentially harmful text has been removed.</p>

            <h3 id="fm-token-limit">Is there a limit to how much text generation I can do?</h3>
            <p>With the free trial of watsonx.ai, you can use up to 25,000 tokens per month. Your token usage is the sum of your input and output tokens.</p>
            <p>With a paid service plan, there is no token limit, but you are charged for the tokens that you submit as input plus the tokens that you receive in the generated output.</p>

          <section id="section-fm-train">
            <h3 id="fm-train">Does prompt engineering train the foundation model?</h3>
            <p>No, submitting prompts to a foundation model does not train the model. The models available in watsonx.ai are pretrained, so you do not need to train the models before you use them.</p>

            <p>When you create a project or deployment space, you specify a IBM Cloud Object Storage and create a bucket that is dedicated to that workspace. These types of objects are stored in the IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket for the workspace:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Files for data assets that you uploaded into the workspace.</li>

            <p>You must upgrade your IBM Cloud Object Storage instance only when you run out of storage space. Other services can use any IBM Cloud Object Storage plan and you can upgrade any service or your IBM Cloud Object Storage service independently.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="section-cosstep">
            <h3 id="cosstep">Why am I unable to add storage to an existing project or to see the IBM Cloud Object Storage selection in the New Project dialog?</h3>
            <p>IBM Cloud Object Storage requires an extra step for users who do not have administrative privileges for it. The account administrator must <a href="../console/wdp_admin_cos.html#cos-delegation">enable nonadministrative users to create projects</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have administrator privileges and do not see the latest IBM Cloud Object Storage, try again later because server-side caching might cause a delay in rendering the latest values.</p>

            <p>For fairness monitoring, the prediction column allows only an integer numerical value even though the prediction label is categorical. How do I configure a categorical feature that is not an integer? Is a manual conversion required?</p>
            <p>The training data might have class labels such as âLoan Deniedâ, âLoan Grantedâ. The prediction value that is returned by IBM Watson Machine Learning scoring end point has values such as â0.0â, â1.0". The scoring end point also has an
              optional column that contains the text representation of prediction. For example, if prediction=1.0, the predictionLabel column might have a value âLoan Grantedâ. If such a column is available, when you configure the favorable and unfavorable
              outcome for the model, specify the string values âLoan Grantedâ and âLoan Deniedâ. If such a column is not available, then you need to specify the integer and double values of 1.0, 0.0 for the favorable, and unfavorable classes.</p>
            <p>IBM Watson Machine Learning has a concept of output schema that defines the schema of the output of IBM Watson Machine Learning scoring end point and the role for the different columns. The roles are used to identify which column contains
              the prediction value, which column contains the prediction probability, and the class label value, and so on. The output schema is automatically set for models that are created by using model builder. It can also be set by using the IBM
              Watson Machine Learning Python client. Users can use the output schema to define a column that contains the string representation of the prediction. Set the <code>modeling_role</code> for the column to âdecoded-targetâ. Read the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Opens a new window or tab">documentation for the IBM Watson Machine Learning Python client</a>. Search for âOUTPUT_DATA_SCHEMAâ to understand the output schema and the API to use is to store_model

          <section id="section-trainingdata">
            <h3 id="trainingdata">Why does Watson OpenScale need access to training data?</h3>
            <p>You must either provide Watson OpenScale access to training data that is stored in Db2 or IBM Cloud Object Storage, or you must run a Notebook to access the training data.</p>
            <p>Watson OpenScale needs access to your training data for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To generate contrastive explanations: To create explanations, access to statistics, such as median value, standard deviation, and distinct values from the training data is required.</li>
              <li>To display training data statistics: To populate the bias details page, Watson OpenScale must have training data from which to generate statistics.</li>
              <li>To build a drift detection model: The Drift monitor uses training data to create and calibrate drift detection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the Notebook-based approach, you are expected to upload the statistics and other information when you configure a deployment in Watson OpenScale. Watson OpenScale no longer has access to the training data outside of the Notebook, which
              is run in your environment. It has access only to the information uploaded during the configuration.</p>

            <h3 id="fairness-score-over100">What does it mean if the fairness score is greater than 100 percent?</h3>
            <p>Depending on your fairness configuration, your fairness score can exceed 100 percent. It means that your monitored group is getting relatively more âfairâ outcomes as compared to the reference group. Technically, it means that the model is
              unfair in the opposite direction.</p>

            <p>The debiasing capability in Watson OpenScale is enterprise grade. It is robust, scalable and can handle a wide variety of models. Debiasing in Watson OpenScale consists of a two-step process: Learning Phase: Learning customer model behavior
              to understand when it acts in a biased manner.</p>
            <p>Application Phase: Identifying whether the customerâs model acts in a biased manner on a specific data point and, if needed, fixing the bias. For more information, see <a href="../model/wos-insight-debias.html">Debiasing options</a>.</p>

            <p>Watson OpenScale works on a deployment of a model, not on the model itself. You must create a new deployment and then configure this new deployment as a new subscription in Watson OpenScale. With this arrangement, you are able to compare the

              to be free from bias but runtime data might induce biased behavior of model.</p>
