        <p>IBM watsonx as a Service is a secure and collaborative environment where you can access your organization's trusted data, automate AI processes, and deliver AI in your applications. The IBM watsonx.ai component provides a studio of integrated
          tools for working with generative AI capabilities that are powered by foundation models and for building machine learning models. The IBM watsonx.governance component provides end-to-end monitoring for machine learning and generative AI models
          to accelerate responsible, transparent, and explainable AI workflows.</p>
        <p>AI engineers, data scientists, and AI risk and compliance officers can accomplish the following goals with watsonx.ai and watsonx.governance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Build machine learning models</strong><br> Build models by using open source frameworks and code-based, automated, or visual data science tools.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Develop with foundation models</strong><br> Generate prompts to generate, classify, summarize, or extract content from your input text. Choose from IBM models or open source models from Hugging Face. Tune foundation models to customize
              your prompt output.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Manage the AI lifecycle</strong><br> Manage and automate the full AI model lifecycle with all the integrated tools and runtimes to train, validate, and deploy AI models.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Govern AI</strong><br> Track the detailed history of AI models and evaluate model output to help ensure compliance.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data engineers can collect, store, query, and analyze enterprise data in a lakehouse architecture with IBM watsonx.data.

            <p>Your watsonx.ai tools are in collaborative workspaces called projects.</p>
            <p>You can use watsonx.ai tools to prepare data and work with models in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Prepare data:</strong> Refine and visualize your data files or data tables in remote data sources or generate synthetic tabular data.</li>
              <li><strong>Build machine learning models:</strong> Automatically generate model candidates, create machine learning model training flows, or write model training code in Python or R.</li>
              <li><strong>Work with foundation models:</strong> Experiment with generative AI prompts, tune foundation models for your use case, or write generative AI solution code in Python.</li>
              <li><strong>Automate model lifecycles:</strong> Create repeatable and scheduled flows that automate notebook, Data Refinery, and machine learning pipelines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For a list of tools, their levels of automation, and whether you can use them to prepare data or work with models, see <a href="../analyze-data/data-science.html">Analyzing data and working with models</a>. For generative AI tools, see

            <p>IBM watsonx.ai has a range of deployed large language models for generative AI. The deployed foundation models include open source models from Hugging Face and IBM foundation models. You can select the appropriate foundation model for your
              inferencing use case. You can customize foundation model behavior by tuning a foundation model.</p>

            <p>Depending on your service plans, you might have a set amount of usage resources per month or you might be billed for the resources that you consume.</p>
            <p>When you run tools with watsonx.ai, you consume the following types of resources:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt><strong>Compute usage</strong></dt>
              <dd>When you run jobs, notebooks, experiments that train or tune models, or deployments, your compute resource usage is calculated based on the rate for the runtime environment and its active duration. Compute resources include the appropriate
                hardware and software that are specific for the workload. Compute usage is measured in capacity unit hours. See <a href="../analyze-data/environments-parent.html">Choosing compute resources for running tools in projects</a>.</dd>
              <dt><strong>Inferencing usage</strong></dt>
              <dd>When you run inferencing against foundation models, your inferencing usage is calculated as the sum of the tokens in the prompt input and output text multiplied by the rate for the foundation model. Tokens are basic units of text. Inferencing
                is measured in resource units. See <a href="wml-plans.html#ru-metering">Resource unit metering</a>.</dd>

            <p>Most users work with assets, which are items that are created or added to workspaces by users. Assets can represent data, models, or other types of code or information. Data assets contain metadata that represents data. Assets that you create
              in tools, such as models, run code to work with data. You can also create assets that contain information about other assets, such as model use cases that contain metadata, history, and reports about models. See <a href="assets.html">Asset types and properties</a>.</p>
