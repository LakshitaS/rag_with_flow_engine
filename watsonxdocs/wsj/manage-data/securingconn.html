        <p>To connect to a database that is not accessible via the internet (for example, behind a firewall), you must set up a secure communication path between your on-premises data source and IBM Cloud. Use a Satellite Connector, a Satellite location,
          or a Secure Gateway instance for the secure communication path.</p>

          <li>
            <p><a href="#satctr">Set up a Satellite Connector</a>: Satellite Connector is the replacement for Secure Gateway. Satellite Connector uses a lightweight Docker-based communication that creates secure and auditable communications from your on-prem,
              cloud, or Edge environment back to IBM Cloud. Your infrastructure needs only a container host, such as Docker. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-understand-connectors&amp;interface=ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Opens a new window or tab">Satellite Connector overview</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="#sl">Set up a Satellite location</a>: A Satellite location provides the same secure communications to IBM Cloud as a Satellite Connector but adds high availability access by default plus the ability to communicate from IBM Cloud to
              your on-prem location. It supports managed cloud services on on-premises, such as Managed OpenShift and Managed Databases, supported remotely by IBM Cloud PaaS SRE resources. A Satellite location requires at least three x86 hosts in your
              infrastructure for the HA control plane. A Satellite location is a superset of the capabilities of the Satellite Connector. If you need only client data communication, set up a Satellite Connector.</p>

          <p>To set up a Satellite Connector, you create the Connector in your IBM Cloud account. Next, you configure agents to run in your local Docker host platform on-premises. Finally, you create the endpoints for your data source that IBM watsonx uses

              <li>The host attach script expires one year from the creation date. To make sure that the hosts don't have authentication problems, download a new copy of the host attach script at least once per year.</li>
              <li>Save the attach script in case you attach more hosts to the location in the future. If you generate a new host attach script, it detaches all the existing hosts.</li>
              <li>Hosts can be reclaimed by detaching them from the Satellite location and reloading the operating system in the infrastructure provider.</li>

          <p>The IBM Cloud Secure Gateway service provides a remote client to create a secure connection to a database that is not externalized to the internet. You can provision a Secure Gateway service in one service region and use it in service instances
            that you provisioned in other regions. After you create an instance of the Secure Gateway service, you add a Secure Gateway.</p>
          <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Secure Gateway is deprecated by IBM Cloud. For information see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/SecureGateway?topic=SecureGateway-dep-overview#q082720___AMQ_SSL_ALLOW_DEFAULT_CERT__title__1" target="_blank">Secure Gateway deprecation overview and timeline</a>.</div>
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Not all connections support Secure Gateway. If the connection supports Secure Gateway, the <b>IBM Cloud Secure Gateway</b> tile will be available in the <b>Private Connectivity</b> section of the <b>Create connection</b>            form. Alternatively, you can filter all the connections that support <b>Secure Gateway</b> in the <b>New connection</b> page.</div>
          <p>To configure a secure gateway:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Configure a secure gateway from the <strong>Create connection</strong> screen:
              <ol>
                <li>Click the <strong>IBM Cloud Secure Gateway</strong> tile.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Create a new instance of Secure Gateway</strong>. <br> <br> Alternatively, from the main menu in IBM watsonx, choose <strong>Administration &gt; Services &gt; Services catalog</strong> and then select <strong>Secure Gateway</strong>.<br></li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Select a region and a pricing plan.</li>
            <li>Under <strong>Configure your resource</strong>, enter a service name and optional tags.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
            <li>On the <strong>Services instances</strong> page, find the Secure Gateway service and click its name.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions to add a gateway <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/SecureGateway?topic=SecureGateway-add-sg-gw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adding a gateway</a>. To maintain security for the connection, make sure that
              you configure the Secure Gateway to require a security token. Make sure you copy your Gateway ID and security token.</li>
            <li>From within your new gateway, on the <strong>Clients</strong> tab, click <strong>Connect Client</strong> to open the <strong>Connect Client</strong> pane.</li>
            <li>Select the client download for your operating system.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions for <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/SecureGateway?topic=SecureGateway-client-install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installing the Client</a>.</li>
            <li>Depending on the resource authentication protocol that you specify, you might need to upload a certificate. A destination is created when the connection is first established.</li>
            <li>In IBM watsonx, go to the project page. Click the <strong>Assets</strong> tab. In the <strong>Private connectivity</strong> section, click <strong>Reload</strong>, and then select the secure gateway that you created.</li>
