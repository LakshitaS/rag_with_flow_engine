          <h2 id="sample-project-and-notebooks">Sample project and notebooks</h2>
          <p>To help you get started with the Watson Natural Language Processing library, you can download a sample project and notebooks from the Resource hub.</p>
          <p>You can access the Resource hub by selecting <strong>Resource hub</strong> from the Cloud Pak for Data navigation menu.</p>
          <p><strong>Sample notebooks</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><a href="https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/39047aede50128e7cbc8ea19660fe1f6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Opens a new window or tab">Financial complaint analysis</a></p>
              <p>This notebook shows you how to analyze financial customer complaints using Watson Natural Language Processing. It uses data from the Consumer Complaint Database published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The notebook teaches
                you to use the Tone classification and Emotion classification models.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/4b8aa2c1ee67a6cd1172a1cf760f65f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Opens a new window or tab">Car complaint analysis</a></p>
              <p>This notebook demonstrates how to analyze car complaints using Watson Natural Language Processing. It uses publicly available complaint records from car owners stored by the National Highway and Transit Association (NHTSA) of the US Department
                of Transportation. This notebook shows you how use syntax analysis to extract the most frequently used nouns, which typically depict the problems that review authors talk about and combine these results with structured data using association
                rule mining.</p>
            </li>

              <p>This notebook demonstrates how to train different text classifiers using Watson Natural Language Processing. The classifiers predict the product group from the text of a customer complaint. This could be used, for example to route a complaint
                to the appropriate staff member. The data that is used in this notebook is taken from the Consumer Complaint Database that is published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a U.S. government agency and is publicly available.
                You will learn how to train a custom CNN model and a VotingEnsemble model and evaluate their quality.</p>

              <p>This notebook demonstrates how to extract named entities from financial customer complaints using Watson Natural Language Processing. It uses data from the Consumer Complaint Database published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
                (CFPB). In the notebook you will learn how to do dictionary-based term extraction to train a custom extraction model based on given dictionaries and extract entities using the BERT or a transformer model.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Sample project</strong></p>
          <p>If you don't want to download the sample notebooks to your project individually, you can download the entire sample project <a href="https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/636001e59902133a4a23fd89f010e4cb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Opens a new window or tab">Text Analysis with Watson Natural Language Processing</a> from the IBM watsonx Resource hub.</p>
          <p>The sample project contains the sample notebooks listed in the previous section, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Analyzing hotel reviews using Watson Natural Language Processing</p>
              <p>This notebook shows you how to use syntax analysis to extract the most frequently used nouns from the hotel reviews, classify the sentiment of the reviews and use targets sentiment analysis. The data file that is used by this notebook is
                included in the project as a data asset.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can run all of the sample notebooks with the <code>NLP + DO Runtime 23.1 on Python 3.10 XS</code> environment except for the <em>Analyzing hotel reviews using Watson Natural Language Processing</em> notebook. To run this notebook, you need
            to create an environment template that is large enough to load the CPU-optimized models for sentiment and targets sentiment analysis.</p>
