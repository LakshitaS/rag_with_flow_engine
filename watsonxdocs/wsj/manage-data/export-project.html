          <p>Exporting a project packs the project assets that you select into a single ZIP file that can be shared like any other file.</p>
          <p>To export project assets to desktop:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Open the project you want to export assets from.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Check whether the assets that you include in your export, for example notebooks or connections, don't contain credentials or other sensitive information that you don't want to share. You should remove this information before you begin the
                export. Only private connection credentials are removed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Optional. Add information to the readme on the <strong>Overview</strong> page of your project about the assets that you include in the export. For example, you can give a brief description of the analytics use case of the added assets and
                the data analysis methods that are used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Click <img src="images/export-proj.png" alt=" the Export to desktop icon" height="20" style="vertical-align:text-bottom"> from the project toolbar.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Select the assets to add. You can filter by asset type or customize the project export settings by selecting preferences (the settings icon to the right of the window title) which are applied each time you export the project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Optional: Change the name of the project export file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Supply a password if you want to export connections that have shared credentials. Note that this password must be provided to decrypt these credentials on project import.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Click <strong>Export</strong>. Do not leave the page while the export is running.</p>
              <p>When you export to desktop, the file is saved to the <code>Downloads</code> folder by default. If a ZIP file with the same name already exists, the existing file isn't overwritten.</p>
              <p>Ensure that your browser settings download the ZIP file to the desktop as a .zip file and not as a folder. Compressing this folder to enable project import leads to an error. Note also that you cannot manually add other assets to an exported
                project ZIP file on your desktop.</p>
              <p>The status of a project export is tracked on the project's <strong>Overview</strong> page.</p>
