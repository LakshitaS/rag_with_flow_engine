        <p>Each of these asset types is available from the project's <strong>Assets</strong> page. Project collaborators with the <strong>Admin</strong> or <strong>Editor</strong> role can open and work with them. Your prompt template and prompt session
          assets are locked automatically, but you can unlock them by clicking the lock icon (<img src="images/locked.svg" alt="Lock icon" title="Lock icon" height="20" style="vertical-align:text-bottom">).</p>
        <p>Editors and Admins can use locked prompt template assets to generate inferences. Only the lock owner can use a locked prompt session asset to generate inferences.</p>

          <p>When you save your work as a notebook asset, a Python notebook is built.</p>
          <p>To work with a prompt notebook asset, complete the following steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Open the notebook asset from the <strong>Assets</strong> tab of your project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Click the Edit icon <img src="images/edit-icon.svg" alt="edit notebook icon" title="Edit icon" height="20" style="vertical-align:text-bottom"> to instantiate the notebook so you can step through the code.</p>
              <p>The notebook contains runnable code that manages the following steps for you:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Authenticates with the service.</li>
                <li>Defines a Python class.</li>
                <li>Defines the input text for the model and declares any prompt variables. You can edit the static prompt text and assign values to prompt variables.</li>
                <li>Uses the defined class to call the watsonx.ai inferencing API and pass your input to the foundation model.</li>
                <li>Shows the output that is generated by the foundation model.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Use the notebook as is, or change it to meet the needs of your use case.</p>
              <p>The Python code that is generated by using the Prompt Lab executes successfully. You must test and validate any changes that you make to the code.</p>

          <h2 id="working-with-saved-prompt-templates">Working with saved prompt templates</h2>
          <p>To continue working with a saved prompt, open it from the <strong>Saved prompt templates</strong> tab of the Prompt Lab.</p>
          <p>When you open a saved prompt template, <strong>Autosave</strong> is on, which means that any changes you make to the prompt will be reflected in the saved prompt template asset. If you want the prompt template that you saved to remain unchanged,
            click <strong>New prompt</strong> to start a new prompt.</p>
          <p>You cannot change edit modes from a saved prompt template.</p>
          <p>Unlike other edit modes, a prompt template that is saved in chat mode also stores the model output. You cannot switch to a different mode from a prompt template that was saved in chat mode.</p>
          <p>When watsonx.governance is provisioned, if your prompt template includes at least one prompt variable, you can evaluate the effectiveness of model responses.</p>
          <ul>

          <p>To continue working with a saved prompt session, open it from the <strong>History</strong> tab of the Prompt Lab.</p>
          <p>To review previous prompt submissions, you can click a prompt entry from the history to open it in the prompt editor. If you prefer the results from the earlier prompt, you can reset it as your current prompt by clicking <strong>Restore</strong>.
            When you restore an earlier prompt, your current prompt session is replaced by the earlier version of the prompt session.</p>
