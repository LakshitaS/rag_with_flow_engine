          <h2 id="runtime-releases">Runtime releases</h2>
          <p>The default environments for notebooks are added as an affiliate of a runtime release and prefixed with <code>Runtime</code> followed by the release year and release version.</p>
          <p>A runtime release specifies a list of key data science libraries and a language version, for example Python 3.10. All environments of a runtime release are built based on the library versions defined in the release, thus ensuring the consistent
            use of data science libraries across all data science applications.</p>
          <p>The <code>Runtime 23.1</code> release is available for Python 3.10 and R 4.2.</p>
          <p>While a runtime release is supported, IBM will update the library versions to address security requirements. Note that these updates will not change the <code>&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;</code> versions of the libraries, but only the <code>&lt;Patch&gt;</code>            versions. This ensures that your notebook assets will continue to run.</p>

            <p>When you open a notebook in edit mode in a CPU runtime environment, exactly one interactive session connects to a Jupyter kernel for the notebook language and the environment runtime that you select. The runtime is started per single user
              and not per notebook. This means that if you open a second notebook with the same environment template in the same project, a second kernel is started in the same runtime. Runtime resources are shared by the Jupyter kernels that you start
              in the runtime. Runtime resources are also shared if the CPU has GPU.</p>
            <p>If you want to avoid sharing runtimes but want to use the same environment template for multiple notebooks in a project, you should create custom environment templates with the same specifications and associate each notebook with its own template.</p>
            <p>If necessary, you can restart or reconnect to the kernel. When you restart a kernel, the kernel is stopped and then started in the same session again, but all execution results are lost. When you reconnect to a kernel after losing a connection,
              the notebook is connected to the same kernel session, and all previous execution results which were saved are available.</p>

            <p>You can select the same Spark environment template for more than one notebook. Every notebook associated with that environment has its own dedicated Spark cluster and no resources are shared.</p>
            <p>When you start a Spark environment, extra resources are needed for the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway, Spark Master, and the Spark worker daemons. These extra resources amount to 1 vCPU and 2 GB of RAM for the driver and 1 GB RAM for each executor.
              You need to take these extra resources into account when selecting the hardware size of a Spark environment. For example: if you create a notebook and select <code>Default Spark 3.3 &amp; Python 3.10</code>, the Spark cluster consumes 3
              vCPU and 12 GB RAM but, as 1 vCPU and 4 GB RAM are required for the extra resources, the resources remaining for the notebook are 2 vCPU and 8 GB RAM.</p>
