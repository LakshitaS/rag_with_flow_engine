            <p>The initialization stage processes the training data, in this sequence:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Load the data</li>
              <li>Split the data set <em>L</em> into training data <em>T</em> and holdout data <em>H</em></li>

                <ul>
                  <li>The training data (<em>T</em>) is equal to the data set (<em>L</em>) minus the holdout (<em>H</em>). When you configure the experiment, you can adjust the size of the holdout data. By default, the size of the holdout data is 20 steps.</li>
                  <li>You can optionally specify the timestamp column.</li>
                  <li>By default, a lookback window is generated automatically by detecting the seasonal period by using signal processing method. However, if you have an idea of an appropriate lookback window, you can specify the value directly.</li>

            <h3 id="pipeline-selection">Stage 2: Pipeline selection</h3>
            <p>The pipeline selection step uses an efficient method called <em>T-Daub</em> (Time Series Data Allocation Using Upper Bounds). The method selects pipelines by allocating more training data to the most promising pipelines, while allocating less
              training data to unpromising pipelines. In this way, not all pipelines see the complete set of data, and the selection process is typically faster. The following steps describe the process overview:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>All pipelines are sequentially allocated several small subsets of training data. The latest data is allocated first.</li>
              <li>Each pipeline is trained on every allocated subset of training data and evaluated with testing data (holdout data).</li>
              <li>A linear regression model is applied to each pipeline by using the data set described in the previous step.</li>
              <li>The accuracy score of the pipeline is projected on the entire training data set. This method results in a data set containing the accuracy and size of allocated data for each pipeline.</li>
              <li>The best pipeline is selected according to the projected accuracy and allotted rank 1.</li>
              <li>More data is allocated to the best pipeline. Then, the projected accuracy is updated for the other pipelines.</li>
              <li>The prior two steps are repeated until the top <em>N</em> pipelines are trained on all the data.</li>

            <p>In this step, the winning pipelines <em>N</em> are retrained on the entire training data set <em>T</em>. Further, they are evaluated with the holdout data <em>H</em>.</p>

            <h3 id="backtest">Stage 5: Backtest</h3>
            <p>In the final step, the winning pipelines are retrained and evaluated by using the backtest method. The following steps describe the backtest method:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The training data length is determined based on the number of backtests, gap length, and holdout size. To learn more about these parameters, see <a href="autoai-timeseries.html">Building a time series experiment</a>.</li>
              <li>Starting from the oldest data, the experiment is trained by using the training data.</li>
              <li>Further, the experiment is evaluated on the first validation data set. If the gap length is non-zero, any data in the gap is skipped over.</li>
              <li>The training data window is advanced by increasing the holdout size and gap length to form a new training set.</li>
              <li>A fresh experiment is trained with this new data and evaluated with the next validation data set.</li>
              <li>The prior two steps are repeated for the remaining backtesting periods.</li>

          <h2 id="supporting-features">Supporting features</h2>
          <p>Supporting features, also known as exogenous features, are input features that can influence the prediction target. You can use supporting features to include additional columns from your data set to improve the prediction and increase your
            modelâs accuracy. For example, in a time series experiment to predict prices over time, a supporting feature might be data on sales and promotions. Or, in a model that forecasts energy consumption, including daily temperature makes the forecast
            more accurate.</p>
          <section id="section-algorithms-and-pipelines-that-use-supporting-features">
            <h3 id="algorithms-and-pipelines-that-use-supporting-features">Algorithms and pipelines that use Supporting features</h3>
            <p>Only a subset of algorithms allow supporting features. For example, Holt-winters and BATS do not support the use of supporting features. Algorithms that do not support supporting features ignore your selection for supporting features when
              you run the experiment.</p>
            <p>Some algorithms use supporting features for certain variations of the algorithm, but not for others. For example, you can generate two different pipelines with the Random Forest algorithm, <em>RandomForestRegressor</em> and <em>ExogenousRandomForestRegressor</em>.
              The <em>ExogenousRandomForestRegressor</em> variation provides support for supporting features, whereas <em>RandomForestRegressor</em> does not.</p>
