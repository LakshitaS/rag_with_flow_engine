        <section id="section-tuning-reqs">
          <h2 id="tuning-reqs">Requirements</h2>
          <p>The Tuning Studio is not available with all plans or in all data centers. The foundation models that are available for tuning in the Tuning Studio can also differ by data center. For more information, see <a href="../getting-started/wml-plans.html">Watson Machine Learning plans</a>            and <a href="../getting-started/regional-datactr.html">Regional availability for services and features</a>.</p>
          <p>Typically, the Tuning Studio is available from a project that is created for you automatically when you sign up for watsonx.ai. The project is named <em>sandbox</em> and you can use it to get started with testing and customizing foundation models.</p>
          <p>If you don't have a project, create one. From the main menu, expand <strong>Projects</strong>, and then click <strong>All projects</strong>.</p>

              <ul>

                <li>For a generative task, describe what you want the model to provide in the output. For example, <em>Make the case for allowing employees to work from home a few days a week</em>.</li>
                <li>For a summarization task, give an instruction such as, <em>Summarize the main points from a meeting transcript</em>.</li>

            <li>
              <p>Choose a task type.</p>
              <p>Choose the task type that most closely matches what you want the model to do:</p>
              <dl>
                <dt><strong>Classification</strong></dt>
                <dd>Predicts categorical labels from features. For example, given a set of customer comments, you might want to label each statement as a question or a problem. By separating out customer problems, you can find and address them more quickly.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Generation</strong></dt>
                <dd>Generates text. For example, writes a promotional email.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Summarization</strong></dt>
                <dd>Generates text that describes the main ideas that are expressed in a body of text. For example, summarizes a research paper.</dd>
              </dl>
              <p>Whichever task you choose, the input is submitted to the underlying foundation model as a generative request type during the experiment. For classification tasks, class names are taken into account in the prompts that are used to tune the
                model. As models and tuning methods evolve, task-specific enhancements are likely to be added that you can leverage if tasks are represented accurately.</p>

            <li>
              <p><strong>Required for classification tasks only</strong>: In the <strong>Classification output (verbalizer)</strong> field, add the class labels that you want the model to use one at a time.</p>

              <p>Expand <strong>What should your data look like?</strong>, and then scroll to see the <strong>Maximum input tokens</strong> and <strong>Maximum output tokens</strong> fields. Drag the sliders to change the values. Limiting the size can reduce
                the time that it takes to run the tuning experiment. For more information, see <a href="#tuning-tokens">Controlling the number of tokens used</a>.</p>

              <p><strong>Optional</strong>: Click <strong>Configure parameters</strong> to edit the parameters that are used by the tuning experiment.</p>
              <p>The tuning run is configured with parameter values that represent a good starting point for tuning a model. You can adjust them if you want.</p>
              <p>For more information about the available parameters and what they do, see <a href="fm-tuning-parameters.html">Tuning parameters</a>.</p>

          <p>The tuning experiment begins. It might take a few minutes to a few hours depending on the size of your training data and the availability of compute resources. When the experiment is finished, the status shows as completed.</p>
          <p>A tuned model asset is not created until after you create a deployment from a completed tuning experiment. For more information, see <a href="fm-tuning-deploy.html">Deploying a tuned model</a>.</p>

          <p>The larger the number of allowed input and output tokens, the longer it takes to tune the model. Use the smallest number of tokens in your examples that is possible to use but still represent your use case properly.</p>
          <p>You already have some control over the input size. The input text that is used during a tuning experiment comes from your training data. So, you can manage the input size by keeping your example inputs to a set length. However, you might be
            getting uncurated training data from another team or process. In that case, you can use the <strong>Maximum input tokens</strong> slider to manage the input size. If you set the parameter to 200 and the training data has an example input with
            1,000 tokens, for example, the example is truncated. Only the first 200 tokens of the example input are used.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Max output tokens</strong> value is important because it controls the number of tokens that the model is allowed to generate as output at training time. You can use the slider to limit the output size, which helps the model to generate
            concise output.</p>
          <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> For classification tasks, minimizing the size of the output is a good way to force a generative model to return the class label only, without repeating the classification pattern in the output.</div>
          <p>For natural language models, words are converted to tokens. 256 tokens is equal to approximately 130â170 words. 128 tokens is equal to approximately 65â85 words. However, token numbers are difficult to estimate and can differ by model. For more
            information, see <a href="fm-tokens.html">Tokens and tokenization</a>.</p>

            is shown on the y-axis. The value that is shown per epoch is calculated from the average gradient value from all of the accumulation steps in the epoch.</p>
