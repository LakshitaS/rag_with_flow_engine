        <p>You create content, in the form of assets, when you work with tools in collaborative workspaces. An <em>asset</em> is an item that contains information about a data set, a model, or another item that works with data.</p>
        <p>You add assets by importing them or creating them with tools. You work with assets in collaborative workspaces. The workspace that you use depends on your tasks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Projects</strong> Where you collaborate with others to work with data and create assets. Most tools are in projects and you run assets that contain code in projects. For example, you can import data, prepare data, analyze data, or
              create models in projects. See <a href="../manage-data/manage-projects.html">Projects</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Deployment spaces</strong> Where you deploy and run assets that are ready for testing or production. You move assets from projects into deployment spaces and then create deployments from those assets. You monitor and update deployments
              as necessary. See <a href="../analyze-data/ml-spaces_local.html">Deployment spaces</a>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can create many different types of assets, but all assets have some common properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#types">Asset types</a></li>
          <li><a href="#common">Common properties for assets</a></li>

        </ul>
        <section id="section-types">
          <h2 id="types">Asset types</h2>
          <p>To create most types of assets, you must use a specific tool.</p>
          <p>The following table lists the types of assets that you can create, the tools you need to create them, and the workspaces where you can add them.</p>

            <h3 id="tools">Common properties for assets that run in tools</h3>
            <p>Some assets are associated with running a tool. For example, an AutoAI experiment asset runs in the AutoAI tool. Assets that run in tools are also known as operational assets. Every time that you run assets in tools, you start a job. You can
              monitor and schedule jobs. Jobs use compute resources. Compute resources are measured in capacity unit hours (CUH) and are tracked. Depending on your service plans, you can have a limited amount of CUH per month, or pay for the CUH that
              you use every month.</p>
            <p>For many assets that run in tools, you have a choice of the compute environment configuration to use. Typically, larger and faster environment configurations consume compute resources faster.</p>
            <p>In addition to basic properties, most assets that run in tools contain the following types of information in projects:</p>

          <h2 id="data">Data asset types and their properties</h2>
          <p>Data asset types contain metadata and other information about data, including how to access the data.</p>
          <p>How you create a data asset depends on where your data is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If your data is in a file, you upload the file from your local system to a project or deployment space.</li>
            <li>If your data is in a remote data source, you first create a <em>connection asset</em> that defines the connection to that data source. Then, you create a data asset by selecting the connection, the path or other structure, and the table or
              file that contains the data. This type of data asset is called a <em>connected data asset</em>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following graphic illustrates how data assets from files point to uploaded files in Cloud Object Storage. Connected data assets require a connection asset and point to data in a remote data source.</p>
          <p><img src="images/data-assets.svg" alt="This graphic shows that data assets from files point to uploaded files and connected data assets require a connection asset and point to data in a remote data source." height="350px"></p>
          <p>You can create the following types of data assets in a project or deployment space:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Data asset from a file</strong> Represents a file that you uploaded from your local system. The file is stored in the object storage container on the IBM Cloud Object Storage instance that is associated with the workspace. The contents
                of the file can include structured data, unstructured textual data, images, and other types of data. You can create a data asset with a file of any format. However, you can do more actions on CSV files than other file types. See <a href="#prop-data">Properties of data assets</a>.</p>
              <p>You can create a data asset from a file by uploading a file in a workspace. You can also create data files with tools and convert them to assets. For example, you can create data assets from files with the Data Refinery, Jupyter notebook,
                and RStudio tools.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Connected data asset</strong> Represents a table, file, or folder that is accessed through a connection to a remote data source. The connection is defined in the connection asset that is associated with the connected data asset.
                You can create a connected data asset for every supported connection. When you access a connected data asset, the data is dynamically retrieved from the data source. See <a href="#prop-data">Properties of data assets</a>.</p>
              <p>You can import connected data assets from a data source with the connected data tool in a workspace.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Folder asset</strong> Represents a folder in IBM Cloud Object Storage. A folder data asset is special case of a connected data asset. You create a folder data asset by specifying the path to the folder and the IBM Cloud Object Storage
                connection asset. You can view the files and subfolders that share the path with the folder data asset. The files that you can view within the folder data asset are not themselves data assets. For example, you can create a folder data
                asset for a path that contains news feeds that are continuously updated. See <a href="#prop-data">Properties of data assets</a>.</p>
