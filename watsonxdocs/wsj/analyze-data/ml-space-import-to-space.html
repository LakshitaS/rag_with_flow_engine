        <p>You can import assets that you export from a deployment space or a project (either a project export or a Git archive) into a new or existing deployment space. This way, you can add assets or update existing assets (for example, replacing a model
          with its newer version) to use for your deployments.</p>
        <p>You can import a space or a project export file to <a href="#import-to-new">a new deployment space</a> or an <a href="#import-to-existing">existing deployment space</a> to populate the space with assets.</p>
        <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> The export file can come from a Git-enabled project and a Watson Studio project. To create the file to export, create a compressed file for the project that contains the assets to import. Then, follow the steps
          for importing the compressed file into a new or existing space.</div>

          <p>The importing mechanism compares assets that exist in your space with the assets that are being imported. If it encounters an asset with the same name and of the same type:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the asset type supports revisions, the importing mechanism creates a new revision of the existing asset and fixes the new revision.</li>
            <li>If the asset type does not support revisions, the importing mechanism fixes the existing asset.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This table describes how import works to resolve cases where assets are duplicated between the import file and the existing space.</p>
