        <h2 id="running-a-pipeline">Running a pipeline</h2>
        <p>You can run a pipeline in real time to test a flow as you work. When you are satisfied with a pipeline, you can then define a job to run a pipeline with parameters or to run on a schedule.</p>
        <p>To run a pipeline:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click <strong>Run pipeline</strong> on the toolbar.</li>
          <li>Choose an option:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Trial run</strong> runs the pipeline without creating a job. Use this to test a pipeline.</li>
              <li><strong>Create a job</strong> presents you with an interface for configuring and scheduling a job to run the pipeline. You can save and reuse run details, such as pipeline parameters, for a version of your pipeline.</li>
              <li><strong>View history</strong> compares all of your runs over time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You must make sure requirements are met when you run a pipeline. For example, you might need a deployment space or an API key to run some of your nodes before you can begin.</p>
        <section id="section-setting-a-job-run-name">
          <h3 id="setting-a-job-run-name">Setting a job run name</h3>
          <p>You can optionally specify a job run name when running a pipeline flow or a pipeline job and see the different job runs in the <strong>Job details</strong> dashboard. Otherwise, you can also assign a local parameter <code>DSJobInvocationId</code>            to either a <strong>Run pipeline job</strong> node or <strong>Run DataStage job</strong> node (the latter is not available for watsonx).</p>
          <p>If both the parameter <code>DSJobInvocationId</code> and job run name of the node are set, <code>DSJobInvocationId</code> will be used. If neither are set, the default value "job run" is used.</p>

      <section id="section-creating-a-pipeline-job">
        <h2 id="creating-a-pipeline-job">Creating a pipeline job</h2>
        <p>The following are all the configuration options for defining a job to run the pipeline.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Name your pipeline job and choose a version.</li>
          <li>Input your IBM API key.</li>
          <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Schedule your job by toggling the <strong>Schedule</strong> button.
            <ol>
              <li>Choose the start date and fine tune your schedule to repeat by any minute, hour, day, week, month.</li>
              <li>Add exception days to prevent the job from running on certain days.</li>
              <li>Add a time for terminating the job.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Enter the pipeline parameters needed for your job, for example assigning a space to a deployment node. To see how to create a pipeline parameter, see <strong>Defining pipeline parameters</strong> in <a href="ml-orchestration-create.html">Creating a pipeline</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Choose if you want to be notified of pipeline job status after running.</li>

        <h2 id="viewing-pipeline-results">Viewing pipeline results</h2>
        <p>After you run a pipeline from a trial run or a job, you can view the status and other details of the run such as parameter results in the <strong>Run tracker</strong>.</p>
        <p>Open each tab to view details of the pipeline run.</p>

        <h2 id="saving-a-version-of-a-pipeline">Saving a version of a pipeline</h2>
        <p>You can save a version of a pipeline and revert to it at a later time. For example, if you want to preserve a particular configuration before you make changes, save a version. You can revert the pipeline to a previous version. When you share a
          pipeline, the latest version is used.</p>
        <p>To save a version:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click the Versions icon on the toolbar.</li>
          <li>In the Versions pane, click <strong>Save version</strong> to create a new version with a version number incremented by 1.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you run the pipeline, you can choose from available saved versions.</p>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You cannot delete a saved version.</div>

      <section id="section-exporting-pipeline-assets-for-deployment">
        <h2 id="exporting-pipeline-assets-for-deployment">Exporting pipeline assets for deployment spaces</h2>
        <p>Watson Pipelines does not support quick deployment or promotion of pipelines like other assets. Instead, you can export a project's or space's assets and import them into a deployment space. When you export, include pipelines in the list of assets
          that is exported to a zip file and then import into a project or space.</p>
        <p>Importing a pipeline into a space extends your MLOps capabilities to run jobs for various assets from a space, or to move all jobs from a pre-production to a production space. Note these considerations for working with pipelines in a space:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pipelines in a space are read-only. You cannot edit the pipeline. You must edit the pipeline from the project, then export the updated pipeline and import it into the space.</li>
          <li>Although you cannot edit the pipeline in a space, you can create new jobs to run the pipeline. You can also use parameters to assign values for jobs so you can have different values for each job you configure.</li>
          <li>If there is already a pipeline in the space with the same name, the pipeline import will fail.</li>
          <li>If there is no pipeline in the space with the same name, a pipeline with version 1 is created in the space.</li>
          <li>Any supporting assets or references required to run a pipeline job must also be part of the import package or the job will fail.</li>
          <li>If your pipeline contains assets or tools not supported in a space, such as an SPSS modeler job, the pipeline job will fail.</li>
          <li>You can automate export import with a CLI tool such as <a href="https://github.com/ibm/cpdctl">CPDCTL</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note attention"><span class="attentiontitle">Attention:</span> When you import a pipeline into a deployment space, dependencies cannot be identified and automatically deployed. You must ensure that all dependencies are deployed for the pipeline.</div>
