        <h2 id="stop-active-runtimes">Stop active runtimes</h2>
        <p>You should stop all active runtimes when you no longer need them to prevent consuming extra capacity unit hours (CUHs).</p>
        <p>Jupyter notebook runtimes are started per user and not per notebook. Stopping a notebook kernel doesn't stop the environment runtime in which the kernel is started because you could have started other notebooks in the same environment. You should
          only stop a notebook runtime if you are sure that no other notebook kernels are active.</p>
        <p>Only runtimes that are started for jobs are automatically shut down after the scheduled job has completed. For example, if you schedule to run a notebook once a day for 2 months, the runtime instance will be activated every day for the duration
          of the scheduled job and deactivated again after the job has finished.</p>
        <p>Project users with <strong>Admin</strong> role can stop all runtimes in the project. Users added to the project with <strong>Editor</strong> role can stop the runtimes they started, but can't stop other project users' runtimes. Users added to
          the project with the viewer role can't see the runtimes in the project.</p>
        <p>You can stop runtimes from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Environment Runtimes</strong> page, which lists all active runtimes across all projects for your account, by clicking <strong>Administration &gt; Environment runtimes</strong> from the Watson Studio navigation menu.</li>
          <li>Under <strong>Tool runtimes</strong> on the <strong>Environments</strong> page on the <strong>Manage</strong> tab of your project, which lists the active runtimes for a specific project.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Environments</strong> page when you click the Notebook Info icon (<img src="../console/images/get-information_32.png" alt="Notebook Info icon" height="20" style="vertical-align:text-bottom">) from the notebook toolbar in the notebook
            editor. You can stop the runtime under <strong>Runtime status</strong>.</li>
