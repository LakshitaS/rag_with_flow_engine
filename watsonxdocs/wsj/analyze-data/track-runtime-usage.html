          <p>The rate of capacity units per hour consumed is determined for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Default Python or R environments by the hardware size and the number of users in a project using one or more runtimes</p>
              <p>For example: The <code>IBM Runtime 23.1 on Python 3.10 XS</code> with 2 vCPUs will consume 1 CUH if it runs for one hour. If you have a project with 7 users working on notebooks 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, all using the <code>IBM Runtime 23.1 on Python 3.10 XS</code>                environment, and everyone shuts down their runtimes when they leave in the evening, runtime consumption is <code>5 x 7 x 8 = 280 CUH per week</code>.</p>
              <p>The CUH calculation becomes more complex when different environments are used to run notebooks in the same project and if users have multiple active runtimes, all consuming their own CUHs. Additionally, there might be notebooks, which are
                scheduled to run during off-hours, and long-running jobs, likewise consuming CUHs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Default Spark environments by the hardware configuration size of the driver, and the number of executors and their size.</p>

          <p>The CUH consumed by the active runtimes in a project are billed to the account that the project creator has selected in his or her profile settings at the time the project is created. This account can be the account of the project creator, or
            another account that the project creator has access to. If other users are added to the project and use runtimes, their usage is also billed against the account that the project creator chose at the time of project creation.</p>
          <p>You can track the runtime usage for an account on the <strong>Environment Runtimes</strong> page if you are the IBM Cloud account owner or administrator.</p>
          <p>To view the total runtime usage across all of the projects and see how much of your plan you have currently used, choose <strong>Administration &gt; Environment runtimes</strong>.</p>
          <p>A list of the active runtimes billed to your account is displayed. You can see who created the runtimes, when, and for which projects, as well as the capacity units that were consumed by the active runtimes at the time you view the list.</p>
