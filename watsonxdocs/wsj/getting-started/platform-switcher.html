        <p>If you are a Cloud Pak for Data as a Service user, you have access to IBM watsonx as a Service and you can switch between the two platforms.</p>
        <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span>
          <md-block>
            <p>Foundation model inferencing and the Prompt Lab tool to work with foundation models are available only in the Dallas and Frankfurt regions. Your Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning service instances are shared between watsonx and Cloud
              Pak for Data as a Service. If your Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning service instances are provisioned in another region, you can't use foundation model inferencing or the Prompt Lab.</p>
          </md-block>
        </div>
        <p>If you signed up for watsonx only, you can't switch to Cloud Pak for Data as a Service and you don't have a <strong>Switch platform</strong> option. To switch to Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, you must sign up for it.</p>
        <p>To switch between platforms:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Log in to either IBM watsonx as a Service or Cloud Pak for Data as a Service. Your region must be Dallas.</li>
          <li>On the platform home page, click the <strong>Switch platform</strong> icon (<img src="images/Platform-switcher-icon.svg" alt="switch platform icon" height="20" style="vertical-align:text-bottom">) next to your avatar, and select the platform.</li>
        </ol>
        <section id="section-service-instances-and-resource-consumption">
          <h2 id="service-instances-and-resource-consumption">Service instances and resource consumption</h2>
          <p>When you switch platforms, you continue using the same Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning service instances.</p>
          <p>The resources that you consume for each of these service instances is cumulative. For example, suppose you use 3 CUH for Watson Studio on Cloud Pak for Data as a Service in the first half of July. Then, you switch to watsonx and use 3 CUH for
            Watson Studio in the second half of July. Your total CUH for the Watson Studio service for July is 6 CUH.</p>

          <h2 id="switch-projects-and-deployment-spaces-between-platforms">Switch projects and deployment spaces between platforms</h2>
          <p>You can switch a project or a deployment space from one platform to the other if that project or space meets the requirements and restrictions. See <a href="../manage-data/switch-platform.html">Switching the platform for a project</a> and

        <section id="section-platform-assets-catalog">
          <h2 id="platform-assets-catalog">Platform assets catalog</h2>
          <p>You share a single Platform assets catalog between the two platforms and any previously or newly added connection assets in your Platform assets catalog are available on both platforms. However, if you add other types of assets to the Platform
            assets catalog on Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, you can't access those types of assets on watsonx.</p>
