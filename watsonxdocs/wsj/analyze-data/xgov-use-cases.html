          <p>An inventory presents a view of all the AI use cases that you can access that are assigned to that inventory. Use multiple inventories to manage groups of AI use cases. For example, you might create an inventory for governing prompt templates
            and another for governing machine learning assets. Add collaborators to inventories so they can view or contribute to AI uses cases.</p>

          <p>You can generate reports from use cases or factsheets to share or preserve records. By default, the reports generate these default reports:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic report</strong> contains the set of facts visible on the Overview and Lifecycle tabs.</li>
            <li><strong>Full report</strong> contains all facts about the use case and the models, prompt templates, and deployments it contains.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The inventory admin can customize reports to include custom branding or to change the fields included in reports. For details, see <a href="xgov-manage-reports.html">Customizing report templates</a>. To create a report:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open a use case in an inventory.</li>
